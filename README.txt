Mandatory dependencies:
-----------------------
Numerical Python (http://numpy.scipy.org)

Optional dependencies:
-----------------------
PyFFTW3 (https://launchpad.net/pyfftw)
will greatly speed up the NSGT transformation is fftw3 is installed on your system

scikits.audiolab (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.audiolab)
is needed for using the built-in audio import/streaming functionality


Installation:
-------------

In the console (terminal application) change to the folder containing this readme.txt file.

To build the package run the following command:
python setup.py build

To install the package (with administrator rights):
sudo python setup.py install


Todo:
-----

- Quality measurement for coefficients of sliced transform
- Unify nsgfwin sliced/non-sliced
